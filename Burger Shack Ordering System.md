# Code Report: Burger Shack Ordering System

## 1. Introduction

The "Burger Shack Ordering System" is a C++ application designed to facilitate the process of ordering food items from a restaurant. This report outlines the code's functionality, structure, and constraints.

## 2. Code Structure

The code is organized into several classes, functions, and features:

### 2.1. Menu Item Classes

The code defines multiple classes for different menu item categories, such as burgers, fries, cold drinks, coffee, ice cream, combos, and custom toppings.

### 2.2. `clearScreen()` Function

A function is provided for clearing the screen based on the operating system, supporting both Windows and Unix-like systems.

### 2.3. `displayMenuAndGetChoice()` Function

This function displays items from a specific category in the menu and retrieves the user's choice.

### 2.4. Main Function

The main function is the entry point of the application.
- It initializes various variables, including menu items, total price, tax rate, and customer details (name, mobile number, table number).
- The program allows users to:
  - Choose items from different menu categories.
  - Customize orders by adding custom toppings to burgers.
  - Calculate the total price, display it, and confirm the order.
  - Select payment options, including card, cash, UPI, and Swiggy One.
  - Rate the service and provide feedback if the rating is low.
- The program concludes by displaying a confirmation message and thanking the user for choosing the restaurant.

## 3. Constraints

The code has several constraints and considerations:

### 3.1. Input Validation

The code lacks robust input validation for user inputs. Invalid inputs could lead to unexpected behavior.

### 3.2. Operating System Dependent Screen Clearing

The screen clearing logic in the `clearScreen()` function is OS-dependent, which may cause issues on non-standard platforms.

### 3.3. QR Code File Paths

The code uses hardcoded file paths for QR code files, which should be adapted to the actual file locations.

### 3.4. Payment Processing

Payment processing is simulated but doesn't include actual payment gateway integration.

### 3.5. Code Testing

Extensive testing is required to ensure that the code functions as expected in various scenarios and edge cases.

### 3.6. Scalability

The code does not address potential scalability issues, such as handling a larger menu or managing multiple customers concurrently.

### 3.7. Security

The code does not address security aspects related to customer data or payment processing.

## 4. Conclusion

The "Burger Shack Ordering System" code provides a basic structure for a text-based menu-driven ordering application. However, it has several constraints and considerations that need to be addressed before it can be used in a real-world environment. Proper testing, input validation, and potential enhancements are essential for improving the code's functionality and reliability.
