## How to Compile and Run the C++ Program

### Step 1: Compiling the C++ Code

To compile the C++ program, open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the C++ code is located. Make sure you have replaced `your-username` with your actual GitHub username in the repository URL. Run the following command:

```bash
g++ src/main.cpp -o restaurant_order
```

This command uses the `g++` compiler to compile the `main.cpp` source code and generates an executable file named `restaurant_order`.

### Step 2: Running the Program

Once the code is compiled successfully, you can run the program using the following command:

```bash
./restaurant_order
```

This command executes the compiled program, which is the restaurant food ordering system.

## Using the Program

After running the program, follow the on-screen instructions to interact with the restaurant food ordering system:

1. Browse the menu and add items to your order.
2. Confirm your order.
3. Choose a payment option from Card, Cash, or UPI.
4. After completing your order, you will have the opportunity to rate the service on a scale of 1 to 10.
